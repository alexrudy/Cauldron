    Parameters
    ----------
    service : :class:`~Cauldron.base.service.Service`
        The parent KTL service.
    name : str
        The name of this keyword.
    
    Notes
    -----
    
    Each KTL keyword belongs to a specific service. The service is retained by weak reference by the keyword, to prevent reference cycles. Keyword objects only read from the keyword store when explicitly told to do so.
    
    Along with the methods of this class, the Keyword interface specifies a dictionary-like interface for accessing features of
    keywords. The dictionary interface implements the following keys:
    
    - ``ascii``: Return the keyword value in the ``ascii`` encoding.
    - ``binary``: Return a binary representation of the keyword value.
    - ``broadcasts``: Whether this keyword broadcasts changes.
    - ``name``: The name of this keyword, uppercased.
    - ``monitored``: Whether this keyword is monitored for changes.
    - ``monitor``: Same as ``monitored``.
    - ``populated``: Whether this keyword has been populated (read at least once).
    - ``reads``: Whether this keyword can be read.
    - ``writes``: Whether this keyword can be written.
    - ``timestamp``: The last modified time of this keyword, usually just the time of last read.
    - ``units``: The units of this keyword.
    
    Only one method is not supported by the original KTL library, :meth:`stop`, which could easily be subsumed into :meth:`subscribe` with the keyword argument ``start=False``.
